Abstract
Cognitive fatigue, a key contributor to failures in high-stakes domains, is poorly understood 
due to imprecise definitions, inconsistent protocols, and neglect of working memory (WM) 
mechanisms. We propose that active fatigue, arising from sustained cognitive demands, 
should be studied through WM frameworks, distinguishing it from passive (low arousal) 
fatigue. Contemporary WM models identify theta/alpha-gamma oscillatory dynamics as 
fundamental to WM function, plausibly providing testable markers of fatigue-induced 
breakdown. Conceptualising active fatigue as specifically a disruption of WM’s oscillatory 
dynamics allows precise identification of its core neurophysiological basis. Specifically, 
tracking destabilised theta/alpha-gamma coupling and frequency synchrony provides a 
direct link to observed performance declines, enabling targeted rhythm-specific 
interventions such as frequency-matched brain stimulation. Current induction tasks rarely 
sustain optimal cognitive difficulty and are confounded by learning effects, prompting us to 
develop WAND (Working-memory Adaptive-fatigue with N-back Difficulty), an open-source 
adaptive fatigue induction N-back suite. WAND reduces learning effects, classifies 
participant performance, and maintains task performance in the "optimal challenge zone"; 
optional distractor probes and multimodal logging enable robust mechanistic analyses. This 
approach shifts the field toward mechanistic, intervention-ready insights, enhancing fatigue

WHEN SYSTEMS FAIL
The 2009 Air France Flight 447 tragedy, where cognitive failures precipitated fatal errors 
during a high-altitude stall (Bureau d’Enquêtes et d’Analyses, 2012), underscores the 
consequences of cognitive failure under pressure. This tragic incident reflects a broader 
pattern across high-stakes domains. For example, 94% of US Air Force aircrew reported 
experiencing at least one performance-degrading effect of fatigue while flying, with 73% 
specifically reporting degraded situational awareness (Miller & Melfi, 2006), whereas in 
healthcare, fatigue impairs performance in 46% of surgical simulator studies, with 
particularly pronounced effects on tasks requiring effortful attention and decision-making 
(Reijmerink et al., 2023).1
These critical breakdowns demand precise tools to isolate cognitive fatigue from 
mere disengagement or boredom (passive fatigue). Current approaches often conflate these 
states, obscuring unique neural mechanisms and undermining effective interventions. 
Building upon existing research, we propose integrating neurophysiological based WM 
models to enhance our understanding. This approach, with refined methodologies for 
1 This paper focuses on active fatigue (i.e., fatigue induced by high cognitive workload), 
which we refer to as cognitive fatigue or simply fatigue, unless otherwise specified. This is 
distinct from passive fatigue (i.e., fatigue stemming from low arousal or disengagement).1

stakes sectors, protecting operational integrity and wellbeing.
BEYOND SIMPLE TIREDNESS: TWO FACES OF FATIGUE
Cognitive fatigue, a state of reduced mental performance resulting from prolonged periods 
of demanding cognitive activity, manifests in two distinct forms: active and passive fatigue.
Active fatigue, tied to high workload and sustained responding (Bernhardt et al., 
2019; Desmond & Hancock, 2001), resembles an engine shutting down under stress. 
Neuroimaging reveals specific neural changes that directly precipitate cognitive declines, 
such as neurometabolic shifts and reduced activation in the lateral prefrontal cortex after 
prolonged cognitive work (Blain et al., 2016; Wiehler et al., 2022), or altered oscillatory 
activity in frontoparietal networks during demanding WM tasks (Karthikeyan et al., 2022), 
linking these overworked neuronal assemblies to core fatigue effects.
Consider for example an air traffic controller managing a congested airspace, 
continuously updating flight paths while filtering critical commands from routine chatter. 
Such roles place a relentless load on WM, requiring rapid encoding, maintenance, and 
inhibition (D’Esposito & Postle, 2015). Crucially, these executive processes are known to 
deteriorate under the strain of cognitive fatigue, leading to measurable performance 
declines (Chen et al., 2021; Hopstaken et al., 2015; Karthikeyan et al., 2022). As active 
fatigue sets in, the controller’s ability to discriminate between essential and non-essential 
updates declines, a real-world degradation that parallels deficits observed in calibrated WM 
tasks. A prominent WM hypothesis proposes a direct neurophysiological cause for this 
breakdown: disrupted neural synchronisation that impairs the brain's ability to coordinate 
and maintain task-relevant information. This framework, built on the principle of a theta-

gamma neural code (Lisman & Jensen, 2013; Miller et al., 2018), is strongly supported by 
recent findings that the integrity of this cross-frequency coupling (CFC) directly predicts WM 
performance (Abubaker et al., 2024; Daume et al., 2024).
As shown in Figure 1, multiple neurophysiological shifts likely underpin these 
declines. One key factor is the accumulation of adenosine, a neurotransmitter that increases 
in the brain during wakefulness and promotes sleep pressure and fatigue. This is evidenced 
by caffeine's fatigue-attenuating effects (McIntire et al., 2017). Meanwhile, dopaminergic 
signalling shifts effort-reward evaluations (Boksem & Tops, 2008; Kok, 2022). Other factors 
including glutamate dynamics, synaptic mechanisms, and cytokine inflammatory markers 
remain under investigation (Chong & Baldwin, 2021; Wiehler et al., 2022).
INSERT FIGURE 1 HERE
In contrast, passive fatigue is a state of under-arousal and boredom from 
continuous, low-stimulation monitoring (Desmond & Hancock, 2001; Goodman et al., 2025; 
Pickering et al., 2024), lacking the pronounced neuromodulatory adjustments of active 
fatigue.
Notably, these fatigue forms are not entirely unrelated; prolonged active fatigue can 
drift individuals to passive, low-arousal states via neural changes. Desmond and Hancock 
(2001) describe this as a protective mechanism where sustained cognitive overload triggers 
compensatory disengagement. Building on this, contemporary models suggest that 
extended engagement of the prefrontal cortex in high-control tasks leads to the 
accumulation of metabolic byproducts that drive fatigue and prompt a shift to lower-energy 
states (Holroyd, 2025; Pessiglione et al., 2025; Wiehler et al., 2022).

Distinguishing between active fatigue, with its substantial neurophysiological underpinnings 
and WM deficits, and reduced arousal states is critical for developing effective and targeted 
interventions (Bernhardt et al., 2019). This distinction has direct implications for WM 
research and fatigue applications.
Passive fatigue, largely driven by under-arousal, can be substantially addressed with 
environmental, reward, or arousal-enhancing manipulations (Papachristos et al., 2024; 
Reteig et al., 2019). For instance, Papachristos et al. (2024) demonstrated that auditory 
interventions effectively boost driver arousal and mitigate passive fatigue directly. 
Active fatigue, by contrast, requires strategies targeting its specific 
neurophysiological mechanisms. Potential strategies include not only arousal-enhancing 
manipulations, but also non-invasive brain stimulation aimed at theta/gamma frequencies. 
Transcranial Alternating Current Stimulation (tACS) targeting frontoparietal areas, for 
example, has improved WM performance in both normal and cognitively fatigued 
individuals (Karthikeyan et al., 2021; McIntire et al., 2017; Nissim et al., 2023). Other options 
such as caffeine (McIntire et al., 2017) and low-dose dopamine agonists (Furman et al., 
2021) also show promise. Given that WM integrity hinges on precise cross-frequency 
synchronisation (Lisman & Jensen, 2013; Miller et al., 2018), distinguishing active fatigue as 
a potential disruption of these synchronies, rather than a simple drop in arousal, is crucial 
for developing targeted, mechanism-based countermeasures like rhythm-specific 
neuromodulation.
THEORETICAL MODELS OF FATIGUE
Current theoretical frameworks consistently overlook WM as a central mechanism in 
fatigue's progression. Existing accounts position fatigue as an adaptive signal, from effort-

regulation to cost-benefit frameworks (Boksem & Tops, 2008; Kok, 2022; Müller& Apps, 
2019; Shenhav et al., 2016). Crucially, these theories overlook integrating WM's specific 
neural and computational properties into fatigue mechanisms, despite likely overlapping 
neural processes.
Recent accounts have attempted to bridge biological and motivational explanations 
of fatigue. The MetaMotiF model (Pessiglione et al., 2025) proposes that sustained cognitive 
control induces neurometabolic changes in Lateral Prefrontal Cortex, such as increased 
glutamate diffusion, which inflate the perceived cost of control and bias decision-making 
toward low-effort outcomes. This model advances earlier frameworks by explicitly 
connecting metabolic state with motivational arbitration. Similarly, Holroyd's 
Controllosphere model (2025) argues that prolonged Dorsal Lateral Prefrontal Cortex 
(DLPFC) engagement leads to accumulation of neurotoxic waste products (e.g., extracellular 
glutamate), discouraging further exertion as a protective response. Holroyd further 
proposes that effort rises sharply with increasing WM-load because each additional item 
requires extra gamma-band binding by DLPFC-controlled circuits. While these models offer 
biologically grounded explanations for fatigue, they lack specific mechanisms connecting 
glutamate-driven neurometabolic changes directly to disruptions in WM oscillatory 
processes, or its core functions: temporal sequencing, computational load management, 
and interference control.
Other prominent theories also touch upon WM but similarly stop short of detailing 
its neurodynamic vulnerabilities. For instance, effort-regulation frameworks (Boksem & 
Tops, 2008) and cost-benefit models involving the dorsal Anterior Cingulate Cortex (Shenhav 
et al., 2016; Kok, 2022; Müller & Apps, 2019) acknowledge WM's involvement or its network

overlap with fatigue-sensitive regions, but do not specify how fatigue compromises WM's 
underlying neural mechanisms. Neurophysiological accounts like local sleep theory (Krueger 
et al., 2019), which posits cortical "off periods" under sustained load, also primarily explains 
behavioural redirection to lower-energy states rather than the specific impact on WM's 
oscillatory architecture or its established computational constraints. 
This theoretical gap has consequences. Because many studies rely on tasks that induce 
monotonous under-stimulation (e.g., Mackworth Clock) or partial WM-load (e.g., low target 
frequency in N-back), they risk confusing high-demand “active fatigue” with “passive 
disengagement” (Goodman et al., 2025). Although papers like Chong and Baldwin (2021) 
and Pickering et al. (2024a) underscore the importance of differentiating these states, 
experimental protocols often neglect this distinction. Even when WM tasks are employed, 
they rarely account for individual capacity differences or engage with contemporary WM 
neurophysiological frameworks, despite that WM's core demands precisely mirror the 
cognitive challenges that induce active fatigue in real-world settings.
Integrating WM's neurophysiological mechanisms into fatigue models offers three critical 
advantages: (1) providing specific, testable neural markers for tracking fatigue progression, 
(2) explaining why certain cognitive tasks prove particularly fatiguing, and (3) suggesting 
targeted intervention points. Without this integration, the field risks perpetuating vague 
constructs rather than advancing mechanistic understanding of cognitive fatigue 
phenomena.
METHODOLOGICAL VARIABILITY AND TASK LIMITATIONS
The lack of theoretical integration is further exacerbated by the wide variability in 
fatigue-induction paradigms (Goodman et al., 2025; Tran et al., 2020). Protocols span the

Psychomotor Vigilance Task, fixed-difficulty imbalanced N-back blocks, mental-arithmetic 
drills, driving or flight simulators, and brief inhibitory-control tasks such as Go/No-Go and 
Stroop. Critically, many of these tasks were developed for other research purposes and are 
not optimally designed to specifically isolate and induce active fatigue. Thus, these tasks' 
differing cognitive demands, duration, and motivational contexts hinder cross-study 
comparisons.
One central challenge is distinguishing “active” from “passive” fatigue, a difference 
that, behavioural evidence shows, unfolds in distinct ways (Pickering et al., 2024b; Saxby et 
al., 2008). Indeed, varying WM task loads can induce different fatigue states; for instance, 
low-load N-back may elicit boredom while higher loads target resource-demanding active 
fatigue (Wylie et al., 2021). The diversity in tasks, coupled with diverging definitions, framing 
fatigue as motivational recalibration [Boksem & Tops, 2008], cost-induced effort withdrawal 
[Müller & Apps, 2019], or as a decision variable in control allocation [Shenhav et al., 2016; 
Kok, 2022], often yields inconsistent findings.
Many protocols rely heavily on subjective ratings (Goodman et al., 2025), which risk 
inflating “fatigue” when behavioural decline is absent, especially due to monotonous tasks 
(Pickering et al., 2024). Additionally, with many studies included in Tran et al.'s (2020) 
review utilizing small sample sizes (often <15 participants), a factor known to affect 
statistical power, minor oscillatory shifts in electroencephalogram (EEG) are easily 
overinterpreted.  Table 1 shows how many tasks induce boredom or intermittent demands, 
confounding active fatigue with passive states.

The aforementioned issues underscore the need for paradigms that more precisely 
target active fatigue. Specifically, they should elicit continuous, high-demand cognitive 
engagement that resist quick habituation or monotony. As we examine next, WM tasks, 
particularly those that can be explicitly calibrated to simultaneously tax multiple executive 
processes, offer a strong framework for inducing and measuring active fatigue. By aligning 
task design with contemporary WM models (e.g., Lisman & Jensen, 2013; Miller et al., 
2018), future work can reduce confounds, more reliably track performance decline, and 
ultimately gain mechanistic insights into the neural substrates of fatigue.
THE SUITABILITY OF WORKING MEMORY TASKS IN INDUCING ACTIVE COGNITIVE FATIGUE
We argue WM tasks represent a reasonable approach for inducing and measuring active 
fatigue. Unlike simpler monitoring tasks, WM tasks demand continuous encoding, 
maintenance, retrieval, and manipulation of information while suppressing distractions 
(D’Esposito & Postle, 2015). Performance declines in monitoring tasks often reflect 
decreased arousal rather than cognitive control breakdown, evidenced by reversal of 
vigilance decrements through motivational manipulation (Reteig et al., 2019). WM tasks, 
however, elicit behavioural and neural decrements reflecting genuine cognitive fatigue even 
when arousal remains stable, evidenced by unchanged baseline pupil diameter and self-
reported sleepiness (Blain et al., 2016).
The N-back paradigm engages multiple neural systems simultaneously, taxing 
prefrontal executive systems critical for WM function (Owen et al., 2005). Under extended 
load, these tasks elicit systematic behavioural and neurophysiological declines. Specifically, 
prolonged engagement in N-back tasks has been shown to reduce lateral prefrontal 
activation (Blain et al., 2016), attenuate P3 amplitude and task-evoked pupil dilation

(Hopstaken et al., 2015), and increase alpha power across frontoparietal networks 
(Karthikeyan et al., 2022). Furthermore, sustained high-load N-back performance maintains 
the DLPFC in gamma-band synchrony with posterior circuits; a metabolically costly control 
pattern that accelerates extracellular glutamate accumulation during prolonged effort 
(Holroyd, 2025; Wiehler et al., 2022).
Transfer studies provide evidence that N-back-induced fatigue affects broader 
cognitive function. Pickering et al. (2024b) demonstrated that dual N-back fatigue impaired 
subsequent Flanker task performance, while Tanaka et al. (2015) found 2-back fatigue 
increased reaction times on non-Stroop trials in a modified Stroop task. These effects 
indicate that WM tasks induce genuine executive control fatigue rather than merely task-
specific decrements. By demanding sustained processing, inhibition, and the continuous 
top-down biasing of information and rules central to goal-directed behaviour (D’Esposito & 
Postle, 2015), WM tasks under high, but appropriate load, specifically tax the prefrontal 
executive systems implicated in active fatigue, distinguishing these decrements from those 
arising from motivational/arousal factors that often compromise other paradigms.
REFRAMING FATIGUE THROUGH WORKING MEMORY: A CONCEPTUAL BRIDGE
Despite its critical role in cognitive performance, WM is largely overlooked in cognitive 
fatigue theories, limiting mechanistic insights. This oversight is problematic given WM's 
fundamental importance for continuous analytical problem-solving in high-stakes tasks. 
Optimal WM function requires complex neural dynamics for goal-directed attention 
and distraction gating (Liljefors et al., 2024; Miller et al., 2018). While these dynamics are 
essential for performance, their vulnerability to fatigue remains largely unexplored.

However, evidence indicates fatigue impairs WM's attentional filtering, disrupting 
visuospatial processing critical for high-stakes tasks (Karthikeyan et al., 2022).
Excluding WM's oscillatory mechanisms from cognitive fatigue models creates a 
critical gap; their integration can elucidate neural dynamics in fatigued states.
CONTEMPORARY WORKING MEMORY MODELS: A MISSING LENS
Contemporary WM models provide detailed neurophysiological accounts of WM processes, 
observable through techniques like EEG and magnetoencephalography (MEG). Influential 
frameworks such as Working Memory 2.0 (Miller et al., 2018), the Neurocognitive 
Architecture (Eriksson et al., 2015), and the sensory recruitment model (D'Esposito & Postle, 
2015) converge on oscillatory dynamics as core mechanisms for item coordination and 
maintenance. We next outline the roles of theta, alpha, and gamma rhythms, and how their 
cross-frequency interactions create an integrated temporal code for WM.
Theta oscillations (4-8 Hz)
Theta provides a repeating temporal scaffold within which individual WM items are 
sequentially activated. For instance, theta phase governs periodic WM content replay 
(Fuentemilla et al., 2010) and dictates the serial activation of item-specific gamma bursts 
during maintenance, supporting the theta-gamma code (Bahramisharif et al., 2018; Lisman 
& Jensen, 2013).
Alpha oscillations (8-12 Hz) 
Alpha rhythms serve an active inhibitory function, suppressing task-irrelevant inputs to 
protect memory contents (Jensen & Mazaheri, 2010). Rhythmic TMS at alpha frequency

over parietal cortex causally enhances suppression of irrelevant WM items 
(Riddle et al., 2020).
Gamma oscillations (30-100 Hz)
Gamma oscillations encode item representations and signify active content maintenance; 
Working Memory 2.0 models posit these spatially distinct bursts as the fundamental coding 
mechanism for discrete items (Miller et al., 2018). Gamma activity at specific occipital and 
temporal cortical sites corresponds to distinct memory contents in a temporally organised 
representation system (Bahramisharif et al., 2018).
Phase-Amplitude Coupling (PAC)
This is a form of CFC, occurs when slow oscillation phase (theta or alpha for instance) 
modulates fast gamma burst amplitude, nesting item-specific representations within a 
temporal scaffold and gating interference. In humans, hippocampal and cortical PAC 
strength predicts WM performance, with stronger theta-gamma coupling linked to higher 
accuracy (Abubaker et al., 2024; Daume et al., 2024). Item-specific gamma peaks align to 
precise theta phases (Axmacher et al., 2010) and alpha troughs coincide with gamma 
suppression in irrelevant regions (Liljefors et al., 2024).
Imagine a concert, the conductor’s baton (theta) sets each measure’s timing; the 
violin section (gamma) plays the melody of each WM item within those measures; the 
percussion (alpha) mutes off-beat distractions. If the baton slows or becomes erratic under 
fatigue, the melody fragments, and if the percussion strikes at the wrong time, the melodic 
lines are obscured.

Fatigue studies frequently employ WM tasks (Table 1), occasionally citing classical models 
like Baddeley's multicomponent framework (Baddeley, 2000), but these references lack 
meaningful theoretical integration. A recent meta-analysis of 72 studies (Goodman et al., 
2025) documents common fatigue-inducing tasks such as Stroop and N-back alongside their 
associated EEG changes in theta and alpha bandwidths. However, neither this meta-analysis 
nor the studies it reviews connect their findings with contemporary WM models, leaving the 
mechanistic role of WM in cognitive fatigue unclear. Despite clear quantitative proof of 
robust spectral shifts, current approaches rarely move beyond simplified band power 
summaries. This approach is limited as it overlooks that effective neural computation relies 
not just on the power of specific frequency bands, but on their coordinated interaction, a 
mechanism that can be directly measured with CFC. For instance, Tran et al.'s (2020) 
systematic review reports large theta (Hedges' g = 1.03) and moderate-to-large alpha (g = 
0.85) increases, an examination of higher frequency oscillations or their interactions is 
absent, reflecting the limitations of the primary studies available for review. Chen et al. 
(2021) similarly identify post-interruption alpha reductions without exploring how fatigue 
might impact the broader oscillatory dynamics, particularly those underlying WM 
operations.
This reductionist focus creates methodological ambiguity. Frontal midline theta, a 
principal index of cognitive control and WM-load (Ding et al., 2024), also increases during 
fatigue (Tran et al., 2020), known as the 'theta paradox' in which it can reflect both control 
and sleep pressure (Snipes et al., 2022). This makes it difficult to discriminate between 
preserved control mechanisms and the earliest signs of network breakdown. By focusing 
narrowly on isolated frequency bands, researchers obscure the distinction between

compensatory engagement and genuine cognitive deterioration. Integrating CFC within 
contemporary WM frameworks is critical to accurately interpreting these spectral shifts.
BRIDGING FATIGUE AND WORKING MEMORY
The integration of contemporary WM oscillatory frameworks with fatigue research remains 
critically underdeveloped. Current approaches overlook cross frequency mechanisms 
central to contemporary WM models (Lisman & Jensen, 2013; Miller et al., 2018). Critically, 
alpha-gamma coupling has never been assessed in any fatigue paradigm, despite its 
established role in WM function. 
To date, only two studies have probed fatigue using CFC. Yang et al. (2018) applied 
theta-gamma PAC analysis before and after prolonged cognitive exertion. Yang et al. (2018) 
used a 4-hour English reading task to induce fatigue and applied theta-gamma PAC analysis 
to EEG recordings from 14 male participants. They found that theta phase across the whole 
brain modulated gamma amplitude in the right central and parietal regions, and that this 
coupling significantly declined following fatigue. However, the study had major limitations: a 
small, all-male sample, no non-fatigued control group, no objective behavioural 
performance measures, coarse treatment of gamma as a broad band (30-130 Hz), and 
limited detail on artefact rejection, mandating extreme caution in interpreting their findings.
Liu et al. (2023) investigated CFC during a 90-minute lane-keeping simulator task, 
which we argue induces passive fatigue due to its monotonous nature and infrequent 
braking events. They observed a rise in beta-gamma phase synchrony, but this was 
calculated only in 1-s windows around foot-brake presses, so the effect is entangled with 
motor preparation, execution and potential learning of that single movement.

Consequently, the study merely shows that beta-gamma coupling may vary in this passive 
fatigue context; it cannot tell us whether disrupted theta- or alpha-gamma interactions are 
affected at all. 
Taken together, these studies highlight a critical gap: fatigue research has either 
focused on band-power changes in theta and alpha, or isolated beta-gamma synchrony 
under passive fatigue. Furthermore, no study has separated low versus high gamma, despite 
their differing roles in sensory coding (<60 Hz) and top-down control (>60 Hz), nor tested 
PAC during high-load tasks, or linked oscillatory disruptions to contemporary WM theory. 
Thus, a critical research lacuna persists: developing a mechanistic account of how 
active fatigue, potentially via the aforementioned metabolic stressors, specifically degrades 
the coordinated theta-gamma nesting and alpha-gamma gating essential for WM function. 
Our perspective posits this degradation as a core neurophysiological manifestation of active 
fatigue.
EVIDENCE FOR WORKING MEMORY BREAKDOWN IN FATIGUE
Many studies, despite their limitations for active fatigue induction, demonstrate WM 
behavioural declines during fatigue: reduced sensitivity (Hopstaken et al., 2015; Wylie et al., 
2021), decreased accuracy (Karthikeyan et al., 2022), and longer reaction times (Pickering et 
al. 2024b). If these reflect genuine WM impairment, not merely motivational deficits, 
corresponding disruptions in WM-supporting neurophysiological processes should be 
observable.
Oscillatory evidence supports this behavioural pattern. Prolonged cognitive load 
consistently elevates frontal-midline theta (Tran et al., 2020), yet power alone cannot

differentiate compensatory recruitment from fatigue-driven impairment. Contemporary 
WM models insist that the pattern of CFC matters: theta-gamma phase coding organises the 
serial refresh of items, while alpha-gamma interactions suppress distraction (Lisman & 
Jensen, 2013; Miller et al., 2018). Intracranial and MEG studies show that stronger theta-
gamma phase-amplitude coupling predicts higher working-memory accuracy in both young 
and older adults (Abubaker et al., 2024; Daume et al., 2024).
Intervention studies increasingly support this. A recent meta-analysis of ten sham-
controlled tACS studies reports a reliable working-memory benefit when task-relevant 
frequencies are externally driven (Nissim et al., 2023). Complementing this, anodal 
transcranial direct current stimulation over DLPFC preserves N-back accuracy past the usual 
time-on-task decline (Karthikeyan et al., 2021), indicating stabilising oscillatory timing can 
counteract fatigue.
Theta peak frequency adapts to cognitive load, slowing to about 4 Hz during complex 
control and quickening towards 7 Hz when demands ease (Senoussi et al., 2022). This 
adaptive timing is essential for the dynamic prefrontal-posterior interactions that maintain 
WM representations (D'Esposito & Postle, 2015), and fatigue would plausibly compromise 
these. Indeed, sustained neural coordination required to maintain these oscillatory 
dynamics under high WM-load likely push neural circuits into Holroyd's (2025) 
'Controllosphere', incurring metabolic costs that destabilise these precise temporal codes. 
Taken together, the emerging picture is that fatigue erodes WM through a cascade of 
specific oscillatory faults:
•
Altered theta peak frequency:  A stretched or compressed temporal scaffold.

•
Weakened theta-gamma coupling:  Mis-sequenced or dropped items.
•
Reduced gamma power: Poorer item representation and chunking.
•
Excessive alpha activity: Over-inhibition of task-relevant inputs.
•
Diminished cross-regional synchrony:  Breakdown of long-range cognitive control-
sensory links.
Under the theta-gamma phase-coding model, gamma bursts encode individual items at 
precise phases of each theta cycle. Lengthening the cycle would space these bursts too 
widely; shortening it would force them to overlap, in either case degrading fidelity. Such 
timing errors provide a concrete mechanism by which cognitive fatigue undermines 
working-memory efficiency, advancing the field from vague resource-depletion accounts to 
a falsifiable network-dynamics framework in which timing, coupling, and regional synchrony 
fail in concert.
SLEEP DEPRIVATION AS A MODEL OF OSCILLATORY IMPAIRMENT
Sleep deprivation effects parallel cognitive fatigue, offering insights into shared 
neurophysiological mechanisms. Though distinct, both seemingly compromise similar WM 
oscillatory processes, allowing sleep deprivation insights to inform cognitive fatigue 
hypotheses.
Sleep-loss experiments offer a way to fatigue the same WM circuits that become 
impaired after prolonged effort. After as little as one night without sleep people show 
cognitive decline on WM tasks similar to active fatigue (Peng et al., 2020; Yırıkoğulları et al., 
2025). While sleep deprivation may prevent necessary synaptic downscaling (synaptic 
homeostasis hypothesis; Chong & Baldwin, 2021), its direct causal link to WM oscillatory

impairments needs further investigation. Nevertheless, electrophysiological studies 
demonstrate that sleep deprivation produces oscillatory disruptions that overlap 
considerably with those observed in cognitive fatigue states.
Zhang et al. (2023) recently showed that sleep deprivation weakens frontal theta-
gamma PAC, and the magnitude of this drop predicts subsequent cognitive performance 
decline. In rested states, frontal theta (normally ~6-7 Hz) adaptively slows towards ~4 Hz 
with rising cognitive-control demands, correlating with better WM accuracy (Senoussi et al., 
2022). After one night awake, that flexible control-theta collapses and a slower, right-frontal 
"local-sleep" theta dominates regardless of task demand, its spread and amplitude are 
associated with the ensuing drop in WM performance (Snipes et al., 2022). In line with this, 
Yırıkoğulları et al. (2025) found that one night awake reduces frontocentral theta power 
during a 2-back task and eliminates the positive correlation between frontal theta activity 
and task accuracy that is present in rested controls. Together, these findings indicate a 
breakdown in theta's role as a dynamic controller of cognitive performance after sleep loss.
FUTURE DIRECTIONS: OPTIMISING EXPERIMENTAL APPROACHES
Task Design
High-load WM paradigms are the most direct way to induce and study active fatigue, as they 
maximally engage the cognitive control systems implicated in contemporary fatigue models 
(Holroyd, 2025; Owen et al., 2005; Pessiglione et al., 2025). N-back tasks are especially 
useful because difficulty can be adaptively adjusted to keep accuracy in a difficulty zone 
where control systems are maximally engaged, without hitting a ceiling (Holroyd, 2025; 
Owen et al., 2005). Non-verbal stimuli (Baddeley, 2000) reduce verbal recoding, stressing

visuospatial circuits and reducing redundancy, confirmed by fMRI-EEG studies (Mencarelli et 
al., 2019). Unpredictable sequences, variable inter-stimulus intervals, and continuous 
demands also minimise recovery and strategy development, ensuring accuracy or d-prime 
(d′; a signal detection measure of sensitivity) declines reflect active fatigue, not boredom or 
excessive difficulty. Furthermore, pairing these paradigms with high-density EEG or MEG will 
be critical for resolving the frontoparietal topography of the predicted oscillatory 
disruptions.
Operationalising Design Principles through the WAND Framework
To address methodological issues, we developed the open-source WAND (Working-memory 
Adaptive-fatigue with N-back Difficulty) suite (Mangan, 2025), with calibration and induction 
protocols using Sequential, Spatial, and Dual N-back tasks.
During the calibration, WAND classifies participants based on Sequential N-back 
performance (level 2 = normal; level 3 = high), a proxy for WM capacity. Adaptive plateauing 
(≤7% variability across blocks) ensures that subsequent fatigue effects are not confounded 
by learning or insufficient task difficulty.
The induction phase keeps each participant in an individualised optimal difficulty 
zone – sufficiently demanding to engage cognitive control, yet not so taxing as to trigger 
frustration or disengagement. An adaptive N-back algorithm targets a 65-82% accuracy 
range to keep the task within the intermediate-difficulty window optimal for provoking 
fatigue (Pessiglione et al., 2025), thereby avoiding floor or ceiling effects and ensuring 
sustained cognitive engagement.

In parallel, a subtle, block-by-block timing compression prevents habituation and 
wards off boredom without pushing accuracy below criterion. Finally, rotating across three 
non-verbal N-back variants (Sequential, Spatial, and Dual) reduces the development of task-
specific automatised strategies, diversifies perceptual context, and sustains effortful 
engagement, while allowing one stream to remain fixed preserves statistical integrity for 
behavioural analysis.
To probe inhibitory control under load, WAND includes optional, precisely timed 
visual distractors (200 ms) embedded within the Sequential task. These enable inhibitory 
analysis without a separate paradigm. Balanced target-lure ratios (50:50), EEG trigger 
compatibility, and subjective fatigue ratings every 15 minutes are included. All behavioural 
data are logged block-wise. WAND thus offers a scalable, reproducible platform to test 
mechanistic WM/active fatigue hypotheses while accounting for individual differences.
While WAND operationalises these principles, it is an illustrative template; other 
high-load paradigms could also serve. Planned experiments should pair WAND with a time-
matched, low-demand control task to isolate fatigue-specific oscillatory changes from 
general time-on-task effects, analysing multimodal outcomes via hierarchical mixed models 
with Benjamini-Hochberg FDR correction.

Methodological Controls
Individual differences shape vulnerability to cognitive fatigue and must be rigorously

arousal factors (chronotype, caffeine use, sleep quality) need standardisation, ensuring 
performance declines reflect true fatigue, not extraneous variability (Van Dongen et al., 
2011). Finally, studies should be powered to detect medium effects (d = .50), with roughly N 
= 34 participants required for 80% power in a within-subject design targeting neural or 
behavioural changes (Button et al., 2013).
Measurement Approaches
To capture the multifaceted nature of active fatigue, researchers should implement a 
comprehensive assessment strategy across multiple domains:
Neurophysiological Markers
Direct PAC studies in active fatigue are rare, but evidence shows that theta-gamma coupling 
strength predicts working-memory accuracy in healthy adults (Abubaker et al., 2024; Daume 
et al., 2024) and reduces after sleep deprivation (Zhang et al., 2023). Band-power markers 
(e.g., posterior-alpha rebounds, frontal-midline theta) remain useful proxies (Goodman et 
al., 2025; Tran et al., 2020) but lack PAC's mechanistic specificity.
Autonomic Indices
Progressive narrowing of task-evoked pupil dilations (Hopstaken et al., 2015) and 
concurrent reductions in high-frequency heart rate variability (Karthikeyan et al., 2022), 
track cognitive fatigue build-up.
Behavioural Metrics
Signal-detection measures like d-prime track declines in sensitivity to task stimuli (Wylie et

al., 2021), offering a nuanced indicator of WM deterioration and its relation to subjective 
fatigue.
Embedded Cognitive Probes
Brief inhibitory-control tasks combined within the main paradigm can expose executive 
function lapses while preserving the continuous demand necessary for inducing active 
fatigue.
Multimodal measures, from PAC dynamics to behavioural and autonomic indices, 
allow researchers to track when oscillatory control begins to decline. These markers define a 
precise window for intervention, enabling rhythm-specific neuromodulation, 
pharmacological targeting, or task recalibration. Grounding countermeasures in the neural 
signature of WM breakdown advances the field beyond vague correlates toward actionable, 
mechanistic models.
CONCLUSION
We argue that a principal route, though likely interacting with global changes in arousal and 
motivation, through which cognitive fatigue emerges is a progressive disruption of WM’s 
oscillatory scaffolding, particularly theta-gamma and alpha-gamma coupling. This reframing 
shifts fatigue research from descriptive accounts to circuit-level explanations. Future studies 
should directly test how sustained cognitive effort degrades these phase-amplitude 
relationships and examine the conditions under which such breakdowns robustly predict 
declines in task performance versus when they might not. The WAND model addresses key 
methodological gaps by standardising strain, reducing learning artefacts, and embedding 
multimodal probes to detect timing disruptions. The resulting framework offers a structured

path forward: identify reliable CFC markers, track decline under load, and test whether 
targeted interventions can restore function. This neurodynamic approach repositions active 
fatigue as a quantifiable disruption of WM's core oscillatory mechanisms, offering concrete 
targets for studying, predicting, and potentially reversing its detrimental effects in real time 
through mechanism-specific interventions.
